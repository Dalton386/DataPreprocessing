This collection works as the toolkit of our research on pathway detection. 

- format_Dendrix: takes TCGA .maf file as input and provides data required in Dentrix;

- format_Mutex: takes TCGA .maf file as input and provides data required in Mutex;

- format_test_Mutex: generates user-defined data to test Mutex efficiency;

- coverage_Mutex: calculate the acceptable gene sets based on user-defined coverage threshold;

- coverage_specific_Mutex: calculate the coverage of user-specified gene set;

- format_UCEC_Mutex: takes UCEC data matrix and CNV matrix as input and provides data required in Mutex;
